    "The NBA is revered as the best basketball league in the world due to its highly competitive and captivating environment, features of the best professional athletes, and the ability for players to sign contracts, thus generating millions of dollars in revenue. Athletes in the NBA are considered some of the best competitors due to their agility, endurance,\n",
    "speed, size, skills, and talent. In the NBA, a single game consists of four twelve-minute quarters and the game clock is intermittently stopped for timeouts, fouls, quarter breaks, and a halftime. This makes it difficult to judge the exact duration that athletes are on the court, but it is estimated that the average NBA game lasts around two and a half hours\n",
    "and some games can last around three hours.[^Lw] This means that these highly skilled players are on the court competing for a considerably long duration, sometimes with little rest at all. Due to these competitive conditions, it is common for NBA players to get injured, and consequently, have to sit on the bench until they recover.\n",
    "Additionally, a typical NBA season for a team includes eighty-two regular season games with the possibility of additional games if their team advances to the playoffs. Overall, this combined with the physicality of every minute of each game creates an environment with a high rate of injury.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics have been taken on the distribution of injury types across the NBA and show that 57.8% of injuries involve the lower extremities, 19.3% for the upper extremities, 10% for the torso, and 1.8% are related to cervical trauma.[^aes5559] Some of the typical lower extremity injuries include the ankles, knees, foot fractures,\n",
    "and muscle tears. Some other common injuries are sprained fingers, concussions, broken noses, facial injuries, and sometimes even leg open fractures.[^Thompson] Among other findings, players who weigh more, are taller, and are between the ages of 26 and 34 are considered the most likely to become injured. Interestingly, a study was administered on NBA games\n",
    "from 1988 to 2005 and showed that there were upwards of 12,500 injuries that took place and around 6,200 of them were related to athletes’ ankles. All together, these statistics are concerning, but the NBA released information last year that stated that the injury rates of players was down about six percent.[^Reynolds]\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to analyze the impact of how the number of injured players on a team affects the overall team’s efficiency and performance. To do this, we will need to take into consideration a player’s injury history, the duration of the player being out, and the number of injured players on a team.\n",

  {

   "source": [
    "Our hypothesis is there is a correlation between higher ranked players getting injured with a lower team record. We predict that injured top ranked defensive players will have the most negative impact on the team record. We also predict that knee injuries will have the most negative impact on players in their future performance. \n",
    "The reasoning behind our hypothesis is because many players are very talented in the NBA and can take over in scoring and other categories while defense intensity is something not all players have. Also knee injuries affect jumping the most, which is a very important part in today's game. \n",
    "Null Hypothesis: Any injury, no matter the ranking of the player, will have the same impact on team record due to random chance. Also, any injury will have the same impact on players in their future performance. \n",
    "The test significance is 5%. \n"

    "*Explain what the ideal dataset you would want to answer this question. (This should include: What variables? How many observations? Who/what/how would these data be collected? How would these data be stored/organized?)* <br>\n",
    "In order to answer how the rank of injured players impacts a team’s ranking, there are several variables and relationships that need to exist in the data. Our dataset must contain tables that include player to injury, player to player ranking/stats, player to their team, and team to ranking/stats associations. <br>\n",
    "While having multiple thousands of data points would be wonderful, our experiment is unfortunately constrained by the injuries sustained during playtime. Each year of basketball in the NBA contains around 1,230 matches, and according to a study by the National Library of Medicine, there are 19.1 athlete injuries per 1,000 exposures. Therefore, there should be on average 1,230 matches * 30 athletes * 0.0191 injuries per match = 704 athlete injuries per year ( two 15 player teams are in each match, giving us 30 athletes). Since we are examining 5 years of NBA data, we should get roughly 3,520 injuries in that timeframe.\n",
    "Most of this data will be collected from NBA Stuffer which provides free data on players, teams, etc. Player injury information will come from an NBA Injuries from 2010-2020 dataset available on kaggle. <br>\n",
    "Currently there are three main tables from these sources that will be used to investigate the hypothesis. More may be added later on.  Ideally we would normalize the tables into 3NF to ensure lossless join and dependency preservation based on functional dependencies that we will establish. Our data may then be stored in an SQL database such as SQLite and read into python through the sqlite3 library interface. Below is a summary of each table. <br> <br>\n",
